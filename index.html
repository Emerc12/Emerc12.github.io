<h2>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>world wide web</li>
  <li>Network printing</li>
</ul>  
<h2>What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</h2>
<p>a client initiates communication with the server in order to request information, while the server responds to requests from clients. </p>
<h2>Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.</h2>

<h3>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</h3>
<p> provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.</p>
<h2>What is hypertext?</h2>
<p> links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.</p>
<h2>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h2>
<p>The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred to formally as World Wide Web (www) is a collection of information that is accessed via the Internet</p>
<h2>Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</h2>
<p>A client sends an HTTP request to a server, specifying the desired action, such as retrieving a web page or submitting form data. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.</p>
<h2>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</h2>
<p>HTTP protocol is the underlying technology that powers network communication</p>

<h2>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h2>
<p>web 1.0, was about connecting information and getting on the net. Web 2.0 is about connecting people putting the "I" in user interface, and the "we" into a web of social participation. The next stage, web 3.0, is starting now.</p>
<h2>Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</h2>

<h2>Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</h2>
<p>its a set of directions that tell the browser software how to display and manage a web document</p>

<h3>Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</h3>
<p>SGML laid the groundwork for HTML and XML, which serve different purposes in web development and data management while DHTML enables dynamic and interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Markdown.</p>
